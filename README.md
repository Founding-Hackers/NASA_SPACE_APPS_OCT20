>Turtle vs Trash Vortex is a game that was created by combining the themes from Nasa Space Apps Challenge and Ludum Dare. You play as Slorp the Turtle with his custom vacuum >pack and you slerp up the trash from the sea while avoiding the fish. It’s an Endless Runner where you speed up as you progress through the game and you aim to improve your >overall score. It was designed to bring attention to the very real problem of the Trash Vortexes and the Great Pacific Garbage patch but in a playful and engaging way.
